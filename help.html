							<li>There could have been an unexpected delay in updating your matchonsports account balance. It may be the case that the bank has not cleared your transaction and we are yet to receive the amount. It is usually added instantly, but in such scenarios, it can take up to 30-45 minutes for the transaction to be updated.</li>
							<li>In case the amount does not get added even after 45 minutes, do not worry!! In scenarios where the transaction is stuck, we do get notified by our Payment Gateway once it gets successful and the transaction is accordingly credited to your matchonsports account.</li>
							<li>In the meanwhile, do go ahead and make another deposit using an alternate mode like PayTM wallet, credit cards, debit cards, or internet banking</li>

				<h5>How can I withdraw my winnings?</h5>
				<p>You can follow the below steps to place a withdrawal query</p>
				<ul class="uli">
				<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Login with your verified matchonsports account</li>
				<li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Go to My Account and if your account is a verified account you will see a Withdraw option under the winnings section.</li>
				<li><strong>Step 3: </strong> Click Withdraw and enter the amount you would like to withdraw. You will receive a confirmation from matchonsports on your registered email id.</li>
				<li>You can withdraw money only from the winnings balance once your matchonsports account is verified. You cannot withdraw the cash amount but you can use it to join more contests and win more. This verification is a one-time process which doesnt need to be repeated unless you wish to make changes to your account. We need you to provide the following bank account details: Name of the bank, Name of the branch, Name of the account holder, account no. and IFSC code. Once your account is verified, you can withdraw the desired amount (min. of Rs.200 and max. of Rs.2,00,000 at a time) and it will be deposited into your bank account within 5 working days.</li>
				</ul>  
				<br>
				<div>
				<h5>Can I use someone elses bank account to withdraw money?</h5>
				<p>Unfortunately, you can withdraw money from your matchonsports account balance ONLY to your own bank account. If you do not have a bank account, your winnings will keep getting accumulated in your matchonsports account balance. Once you get a bank account in your name, you can use the same to get your matchonsports account verified and place your withdrawal requests.</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div>
				<h5>Its been over 5 working days but Ive still not received the withdrawal in my bank account?</h5>
				<p>Please make sure that you are checking the same bank account which you have submitted during your bank verification. The payout entry in your bank statement would be in the name of FIDUCIARY BILLING SOLUTION</p>
				<p>In case you do not receive the payout post 5 working days of withdrawal request, your withdrawal may have been rejected by your bank. The most common reason for the rejection may be an incorrect account number, wrong IFSC code, NRI account etc.</p>
				<p>In case there has been a rejection, we have you covered! Well reverse the money back into your matchonsports account so that you can update your details and place a new withdrawal request again.</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div>
				<h5>Do I have to pay taxes when I withdraw money to my bank account?</h5>
				<p>Taxes are deducted at source wherever applicable and paid out by us, as per the Income Tax Act 1961. Thus, if your individual winnings for a single contest are more than Rs.10,000, a tax of 31.2% will be deducted. The remaining amount (68.80%) will be credited to your winnings balance. For e.g. If you win Rs.1,00,000, Rs.31,200 will be deducted and your actual winnings are Rs.68,800</p>
				<p>Winners will be provided TDS certificates in respect of such tax deductions, if applicable. However, you shall be responsible for payment of any other applicable tax, including but not limited to, income tax, gift tax, etc. in respect of the Cash Prizes money won. If you have any queries regarding taxation, we strongly suggest that you consult with a tax expert. For more information please check our Terms and Conditions..</p>

					<h5>When do the scores get updated?</h5>
					<p>Points are usually updated every few minutes! However, when the match ends, the status changes from In Progress to Waiting For Review. In this time, the final points including your team's total and your rank are updated. Winners are declared and winnings are distributed only after our team verifies the final points. This process may take up to 2 hours. In certain cases, it could take longer. After the winners are declared, the match status will be Completed.</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
					<h5>How will I score points?</h5>
					<p>You will score points depending on how the players in your team perform in the live match. So, make sure you pick a winning combination to help you win BIG! Check out our detailed Points System to understand how to score on matchonsports.</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
					<h5>What happens when a ODI/T20 match is abandoned or not played out fully?</h5>
					<p>If the real match is abandoned, the match will be cancelled and the entry fees will be refunded. This includes scenarios where the real match is abandoned without a single ball being bowled, as well as where the match is abandoned after it has started.</p>
					<p>If the real match has a result even if not played out fully, we will announce the results of the match as per the fantasy scorecard points accumulated, except where a result is a consequence solely of (i) the results of a Super Over or Bowl Out, (ii) the toss of a coin, (iii) prior results between or relative standings of the teams in the tournament, or (iv) any methodology other than those envisaged by the official score revision rules (e.g., Duckworth Lewis Stern) applicable to weather affected matches in the particular tournament.</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
					<h5>What happens when a match is tied?</h5>
					<p>When a match is tied, winners are still declared at the end of the match on the basis of the points and ranks of users participating in the contest</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
					<h5>Why are my teams points/ranks not updated correctly?</h5>
					<p>Points/ranks can sometimes take a bit longer than usual to reflect. However, the final scores, points and rankings are reflected once the match is completed. We also verify the points with live score feeds provided by reliable sources to ensure that the points/ranks are correctly reflected after every match.</p>

						<h5>How will I be informed if I win a Cash prize?</h5>
						<p>Ranks and points will be updated and displayed during and at the end of every match. If you win in any cash contest, the winnings will be credited automatically to your matchonsports account balance.</p>
						
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
						<h5>When will the winnings be distributed?</h5>
						<p>The winner declaration and crediting of the winnings to your matchonsports account usually happens within a couple of hours after the match is completed. Our dedicated team manually verifies the matchonsports scorecard with our live feed to ensure that the points and scores are correctly updated after every match. This procedure can sometimes take a relatively long time. Only after we are sure that all points and scores are accurate, the final points are updated and winners are declared..</p>
						
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
						<h5>Does the amount in my Winnings Account have any expiry date?</h5>
						<p>If the amount in your Winnings Account is not withdrawn to your bank account within 335 days from the date of credit, it will be deposited automatically to your bank account which is on record with matchonsports, provided that your matchonsports account has verified by matchonsports. In case no bank account is provided or you have failed to complete the verification for the matchonsports account, the amount would stand forfeited by matchonsports. Hence it's important that you get your matchonsports account verified as soon as possible. Please check our Terms & Conditions for detailed information on this aspect. .</p>

					<h5>How can I verify my account?</h5>
					<p>To verify your account, open the menu, click on Verify Now button & follow these steps:</p>
						<ul class="uli">
						<li>Verify your mobile number by entering the OTP sent to your phone and submit.</li>
						<li>Check your email and click on the Verify Now button to verify your email ID registered with matchonsports</li>
						<li>Enter your PAN number, upload your PAN Card image and submit. Please note that you will able to place a PAN verification request only if your winnings balance is more than Rs. 200.</li>
						<li>Enter your bank details, upload your bank account proof and submit.</li>
						<li>Mobile and email verification are done instantly once you follow the above steps. Once PAN and bank details are submitted, you will receive an update within 5 working days!</li>
						
						</ul>  
						<p>In case you have only updated your PAN verification request, please go ahead and submit your bank verification as well so that both your requests are processed on priority.</p>
						<p>Note: You can join contests even without verifying your account. When you win Cash Contests, your winnings will be deposited in your matchonsports account. Verification becomes mandatory only before you can make withdrawals from your matchonsports account to your bank account. The minimum winnings balance needed to place a withdrawal request is Rs. 200</p>
						</div>
					<br>
					<div>
						<h5>Can I verify more than one account with same PAN Card and bank account?</h5>
						<p>Creating multiple accounts violates our FairPlay policy and hence you cannot verify multiple accounts using same PAN and bank details.</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
						<h5>Why do I need a PAN Card to verify my account?</h5>
						<p>Your withdrawals involve transfer of money from your matchonsports account to your bank account. Hence, PAN Card is mandatory to get your account verified, due to regulatory requirements.</p>
						<p>If you do not have a PAN Card, you can apply for one and submit a verification request when you receive it. In the meantime, you can still join contests and your winnings will keep getting accumulated in your matchonsports account</p>
						</div>
					<br>
					<div>
						<h5>Why did my verification fail? OR Why was my verification request declined?</h5>
						<p>Some of the major reasons why your verification request may have failed are:</p>
						<ul class="uli">
						<li>You didn't upload an image of your PAN Card Your withdrawals on matchonsports involve a transfer of money. Hence, PAN Card is mandatory to get your matchonsports account verified. Please upload a clear image of your PAN Card.</li>
						<li>PAN number on the card does not match the PAN number entered during verification request Double check the PAN number that you have entered to avoid errors</li>
						<li>Date of Birth on the PAN Card does not match the Date of Birth on your matchonsports account. Please ensure that you enter the exact Date of Birth on the verification request as it appears on the PAN Card</li>
						<li>Name on the PAN Card does not match the name on the bank account You can withdraw money from your matchonsports account only to your own bank account. Hence, the name on the PAN Card and bank account need to match.</li>
						<li>IFSC code provided in the bank details is incorrect/belongs to a different bank branch than the one mentioned for verification purposes. If you provide the wrong IFSC code, your money could be transferred to someone else's account. So, make sure you enter the correct code. You can find the IFSC code in your cheque book, passbook or bank statements. If you're not sure, please contact your bank to get the correct code.</li>
						<li>The documents uploaded by you are not clear/visible. Our experts are humans after all! Please help them by uploading documents where all the details are clearly visible so that they can verify your details quickly.</li>
						<li>Bank account number entered in verification request does not match with account number appearing on the uploaded proof. Please ensure that you enter the exact bank account number in the verification request, as it appears on the bank account proof. In the rare case that your verification request gets rejected, the reason for rejection will appear on top of the verification page for your reference.</li>
						</ul>  
						</div>
					<br>
					<div>
						<h5>My verification request has been submitted, but not yet verified?</h5>
						<p>It takes around 5 working days to process your verification request from the date you submit your request. Be rest assured that you will receive an email notification once it has been completed.</p>
						
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
						<h5>Why am I facing issues with mobile number verification?</h5>
						<p>Make sure you are using a mobile number that is not already registered or verified on matchonsports. If you are still facing an issue verifying your mobile number, please reach out to us with the screenshot of the error message so that we can investigate it accordingly.</p>

					<div>
						<h5>How do I earn the referral bonus?</h5>
						<p>Once your invited friends join cash contests on matchonsports, you will get a cash bonus equal to 1/3rd of their entry fee.

						<h5>My friend has registered using my invite code and played cash contests as well. When will I start getting my referral bonus?</h5>
						<p>Some of the major reasons why your verification request may have failed are:</p>
						<ul class="uli">
						<li>Your friend must be displayed in your Invite Friends dashboard to make you eligible for the bonus. Please visit the Invite Friends section in the menu and then click on the link at the bottom of the screen to locate your Invite Friends Dashboard.</li>
						<li>Once you find your friend in the list, relax! Please note that you will get the applicable cash bonus in your account within 48 hours after the winners of the match (your friend has joined cash contest/s in) are declared.</li>
						<li>You will receive 1/3rd of the total amount your friend has joined cash contest/s with (maximum Rs.100 from each friend).</li>
						<li>In case your friend is not showing up in your Invite Friends list, he/she may have missed entering your invite code during registration on the Android/iOS app. In this scenario, he/she would not have received the invite a friend bonus as well.</li>

						<h5>My cash bonus/invite code has been blocked. How do I unblock it?</h5>
						<p>Our system would have detected FairPlay Violation on your matchonsports account due to which the cash bonus and invite code gets blocked. This usually happens when an invite code is used to create multiple (fake) accounts on matchonsports. We suggest that you follow the following steps to unblock your Cash Bonus / referral (invite) code. Please make sure that you are using the latest Android/iOS app.</p>
						<p>To unblock cash bonus:</p>
						<ul class="uli">

						<li>Click on How to Unblock and follow the instructions.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
						<h5>I registered using a referral code however I did not receive any cash bonus. Why?</h5>
						<p>In order to get the referral bonus, you need to enter a valid invite code (shared by your friend) during registration. If you have missed entering it during registration, unfortunately, you are not eligible for the bonus.</p>
						<p>However, you can get a cash bonus by inviting your friends and getting them to register using your invite code (max bonus of Rs. 100 per friend). You can find your invite code by visiting the Invite Friends section in the menu.</p>
